People can start exploring the advantages of innovation of technology and use a system like this, (RoomRadar: A Room Reservation System) for their needs, wants and all things associated with it. 


## II. üìÅPython Concepts and Libraries
**Python Tkinter**

In the system, Python Tkinter was used to create a graphic user interface. GUI are the display like text with colors, buttons, message box and other more unlike just pure  letters in a console program. Tkinter is a python module that allows programmers to create a more interactive system that consists of buttons, different designs and advanced features. It also provides an aesthetically pleasing environment for the users. 

**MySQL**

MySQL plays a vital role in the creation of databases in the system. This is the language used to create tables, attributes, records of the connected database to the system.
Using MySQL, the need for a database of this system was accomplished and the interaction of data reservation is smooth. This enables the system admin to manipulate the data.
## III. üåè Integration of SDG (Sustainable Development Goal)

### Chosen SDG: **Goal 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth**

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure

The system is associated with a digital approach that allows a no-appearance reservation by the user and secures anything indicated in the reservation. It promotes innovation especially in rural areas wherein there are numerous hotels but guests cannot assure the reservation until they book it personally which is time consuming and not practical. The automation of this system enhances operational efficiency, reducing reliance on manual processes and minimizing human error, which is a vital part of innovating and modernizing transactions. As this system of innovation emerges, the modern time of technology grows for more and for the better. Not only for the wants of users, but most especially for essentials of different people who need comfort and accommodation. 


SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Integration of innovation and business leads to the growth of the economy. The system provides an opportunity for businesses to bloom with the use of a system like this.

Additionally, the data insights provided by the system can help hotels refine their marketing and pricing strategies, improving financial stability and ensuring long term growth.  

## IV. ‚öôÔ∏èInstructions for Running the Program

### Requirements:
- A text editor or IDE (such as Vscode) to open and edit the Python file.
- Download all necessary extensions 
- Make sure to have XAMPP for database purposes 

### Steps to Run the Program:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:

 1.1  Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
   - In cloning the Repository, follow these steps:

    Copy the repository's URL:
   https://github.com/djquizzagan/QUIZZAGAN_ACP_FinalProject

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Run the following command:
  
   git clone https://github.com/djquizzagan/QUIZZAGAN_ACP_FinalProject


 1.2 Navigate to the Project Directory:
   - Open or Make sure to Download (if you dont have any) an IDE like Vscode and navigate to the directory where the files are stored. Also, a local server environment like xampp is needed to connect this program to the database created and use that to save all the reservation of the system. 

### Steps to Use the Program:

1. Once done setting up the IDE, go to xampp and start MySQL to enable the connection of the database when it is not started, the program still run but the reservations will not be saved on the database and Apache if you want to view the tables of the database using the browser(phpmyadmin). 
2. Once those two are already set, the user can start running or debugging the program, just click the triangle button on the upper right part of the IDE, when it does not have an error, then it will proceed to the system interface or the program‚Äôs main dashboard. 
3. If the user already reaches the main dashboard, they will see different labels and buttons that contain the function of the system. 
4. Users will see the buttons named, the STANDARD, SUITE, DELUXE which refers to the room types that user can choose from, the ADMIN wherein base on its name, it is for the admin and they can manipulate the reservations, also there is the HISTORY RESERVATION that will display the current reservation in the database that can help user in choosing their preferred dates. 
5. When the user clicks the button STANDARD or SUITE or Deluxe, they will proceed to another window showing different rooms inside the category or type they choose. The user can choose which one they want and click it. 
6. After clicking the button beside the room and its features, another window will appear and the user will input their information that is needed to reserve a room then they will click submit.
7. Once submitted, and there is no error like invalid format of date, or having the same date of reservation, the program will display another window containing the full details  of the reservation and it means that it was successful and already saved in the database( if MySQL in xampp was started, if not, it will not be save).
8. If the user wants to check the reservation, they can check it by clicking the HISTORY RESERVATION button. 
9. For the ADMIN button, once it is clicked, a window showing admin login shows up and the admin needs to type their username and password to enter the admin dashboard. 
10. If the input of admin is correct and they clicked login, the admin dashboard will show up and there, the admin can see the button VIEW GUEST, to see who are the guests who booked a reservation, VIEW RESERVATION, to see the date of reservation, guestID of guest who reserve that specific room and roomID of the room they choose. Lastly, the VIEW ROOM to see the different rooms. 
11. The admin has the ability to delete guest, reservation and room, they just need to click the delete button shown in the lower part of the window once they click VIEW GUEST or VIEW RESERVATION or VIEW ROOM.
